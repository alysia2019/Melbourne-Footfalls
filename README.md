# Melbourne Footfall Analysis and Modelling

## Basic Data Analysis

### Data Format Analysis
ðŸ“Š **Notebook**: [`data_format_analysis.ipynb`](./Python%20scripts/basic_analysis/data_format_analysis.ipynb)
   - Get acquainted with the data format we choose for further study

### Imputation Analysis
ðŸ“ˆ **Notebook**: [`imputation_analysis.ipynb`](./Python%20scripts/basic_analysis/imputation_analysis.ipynb)
   - Experienemnts of imputation

## Data Pre-Processing

### How to Run:
ðŸ”„ **Notebook**: Simply execute the [`Melbourne_footfall_data_preprocessing.ipynb`](./Python%20scripts/Melbourne_footfall_data_preprocessing.ipynb) notebook to perform the necessary data pre-processing.

### Pre-Processing Steps:
1. **Duplicate Data Handling**: 
   - Purpose: Maintain data integrity and accuracy.
   - Action: Identify and eliminate records with duplicate sensor IDs, location IDs, or geo-locations.

2. **Sensor ID Unification**: 
   - Purpose: Achieve consistency across datasets, especially for data collected in 2023.
   - Action: Augment records from 2023 that only contain Location IDs with the corresponding sensor names and geo-locations.
